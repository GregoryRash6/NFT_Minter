# How to Mint and List an NFT for Sale!

### Step One: Create the Solidity Contract
#### How to Creating the Solidity Contract
1. Determine Solidity version to use. This walkthrough uses 
```
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;
```
2. Import necessary depencies. This walkthrough uses<br>

```
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v3.4/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v3.4/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v3.4/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
```

3. Set contract to ERC721 for Non-Fungible Tokens.
4. Initialize counter for contract.
5. Assign counter to variable token ID's.
6. Create unique identifier based off hash value
7. Construct NFT using eRC721 protocol.
8. Create a function to mint the NFT's.
9. Ensure NFT based on the provided token URI has not previously been created 
10. Increments the counter to one to prevent a second NFT from being minted
11. Increment the counter.
12. Assign Token ID's.
13. Mint tokens.
14. Set token URI.
15. Return token ID.

### Step Four: Deploy Contract
#### How to Deploying the Contract
1. Ensure MetaMask network is set to `Rinkeby Test Network`.
2. Select `Injected Web3` on the environment.
3. Step two should automatically connect you to MetaMask. Ensure you are on the right account for the transaction.

### Step Six: Create Token Metadata JSON File
#### How to Create Token Metadata JSON File
1. Create a JavaScript object with three key value pairs.
2. The first key is called `name`. The first value is your desired NFT token name.
3. The second key is called `description`. The second value is your desired NFT token description.
4. The third key is called `image`. The third value is your image hash from Pinata preceeded by `ipfs://`.
5. Upload the completed JSON file to Pinata.
